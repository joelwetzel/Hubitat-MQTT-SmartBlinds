# Hubitat MQTT SmartBlinds
Hubitat driver and NodeMCU (ESP8266) firmware for smart blinds.

This is a work in progress.

The hardware and firmware is heavily based on the work of Smart Home Hookup here:  https://github.com/thehookup/Motorized_MQTT_Blinds  Much thanks to that dude!

The Hubitat driver will be my own creation, using the MQTT support that Hubitat added last year.
